<h3> Description of the Code</h3>
<h4> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction involves using machine learning models to assess an individual's risk based on factors like age, lifestyle, and medical history. Data collection from various sources is crucial, and models such as logistic regression or neural networks are commonly used. These models aim for personalized risk assessment, enabling early detection and targeted interventions. Evaluation metrics like accuracy and precision ensure model reliability. Continuous improvement, integration into healthcare systems, and addressing ethical considerations are essential for the success of CVD prediction models.</h4>
